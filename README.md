**Are you ready to take on the challenge of a difficult wire action game?**

Uekibati-kun needs your help!  
Waking up in a mysterious place, he finds himself haunted by a strong sense of unfinished business, despite not remembering the events from his past. Driven by this lingering feeling, he sets out toward the distant light.

The controls are simple, but the journey is anything but easy...  
Jump, hang on wires, and sometimes time your movements to reach the goal.

Help Uekibati-kun, who wishes, “Please, someone clear this. I’ll do anything for you,” to carve out his fate with your hands!

## Controls
- Move [←→], Jump [X], and use the Wire [Z] to explore new areas!
- While hanging, use Jump [X], shake the wire [←→], or adjust its length [↑↓] to find a way through!
- Check the map [C] to navigate without getting lost!

## Note

This game does not contain elements from "Manatsu no Yo no Inmu".
